        <div class="title">COVID 19 Economic Analysis</div>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe change in consumer spending. Let us take a deeper dive into the data, the stories behind it, and the implications.

        <div class="title">Only the Beginning</div>
        "We haven't even begun to see the end of it yet" ~ Dr. Fauci on July 13, 2020. <br>
        By November 2020, over 12.6 million people in the U.S. have been infected by COVID-19.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">When it All Began...</div>
        On February 29, 2020, Washington state (orange) became the first to announce a state of emergency due to COVID-19.
        Two and a half weeks later, California (red) became the first state to institute a state-wide lockdown on March 19, 2020.

        <div class="title">Lockdowns in March</div>
        Following California's lead, 32 states announced state-wide lockdowns (red) and 12 other states
        announced partial lockdowns (orange) by March 31st, 2020. In March alone, 316 million people across 42 states
        were being urged to stay home. <br>

        <div class="title">A New Normal</div>
        In the period of three weeks, virtually the entire U.S. had to adopt to a new normal.
        One in which hindered people from working, buying, and traveling. <br>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">A Sharp Drop</div>
        Following lockdowns in March of 2020, consumer expenditure in the U.S. experienced a sharp drop.
        At the same time, there has been a surge in usage of Zoom and other technological services.
      </section>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Recovery So Far</div>
        As some states eased lockdown measures, GDP and consumer expenditure has rebounded slightly, although we are nowhere close to a full recovery.
      </section>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">A Tale of Two Recessions</div>
        Public concern for the U.S. economy is reminiscent of the 2008-09 recession.
        We see here in the graph of U.S. consumer expenditures that the COVID-19 recession has experienced a much sharper
        drop and rebound compared to 2008-10.
      </section>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Consumer Expenditure</div>
        Let's see how people spent their money in different sectors for COVID.
        Some sectors, like food and technology, have rebounded. Others, like gas, have remained stagnant.
        This points to a striking imbalance in our current economy -- while some sectors are ruined beyond repair, others are thriving.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Federal Funding</div>
        Here you can see the distribution of federal funding through PPP (paycheck protection program).
        It's clear that people in many states have clearly not received enough government loans. <br>
        Without these government loans (akin to 2008's financial bailouts), thousands of small businesses
        are struggling to survive. We encourage you to ask your congress representatives to fight for more
        legislation to help out your local economy!
